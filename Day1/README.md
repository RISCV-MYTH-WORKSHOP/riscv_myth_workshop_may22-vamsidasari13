# Day 01  

•	Introduction to RISC-V ISA

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA), meaning it is provided under open source licenses and available to the public. It is comprised of a base integer ISA (RV32I/RV64I) with optional extension ISAs and belongs to the little endian memory addressing system.

•	GNU Compiler Toolchain

The GNU compiler toolchain is a collection of programming tools used for developing applications and operating systems; it has tools that make and compile code into machine-readable programs.

# Day 02

•	Application Binary Interface (ABI)

The Application Binary Interface (ABI), also known as the System Call Interface, is used by the program to access the ISA registers. RISC-V architecture contains 32 registers of width 32/64 if using RV32I/RV64I.

•	Day 2 Lab: ABI Function Calls

A simple program for summing numbers 1 to 9 was created; view source in Day2 folder. The compiled output in assembly.
