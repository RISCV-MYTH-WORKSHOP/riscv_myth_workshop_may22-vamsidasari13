# Day 03

â€¢	TL-Verilog and Makerchip

Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) is a hardware descriptive languagethat extends Verilog in the context of pipelines, it maintains behavior of the circuit while being timing abstract, which means it takes care of retiming.
Makerchip is a free online platform made by Redwood EDA. It supports TL-Verilog, SystemVerilog, and Verilog languages to code, compile, simulate, and debug digital designs.

###	Day 3 Lab: Calculator Single Value Memory Lab

A simple calculator with single value memory and validity was created.The diagram and viz showing one cycle of operation:

# Day 4

   RISC-V Microarchitecture

The building blocks of a simple CPU are program counter (PC), instruction memory (IMem Rd), instruction decoder (Dec), register file read (RF Rd), arithmetic logic unit (ALU), register file write (RF Wr), and data memory (DMem Rd/Wr). The following diagram depicts the connections between these blocks:

### Day 4 Lab: Simple RISC-V Core

A simple RISC-V core from fetch and decode to control logic with branching was created. The diagram and viz showing final instruction executed:

# Day 5
Complete Pipelined RISC-V CPU micro-architecture
Day 5 of the workshop included the following:

 1. Pipelining the CPU
 2. Load and store instructions and memory
 3. Completing the RISC-V CPU
 4. Wraping-up
 
Finally, the RISC-V core was developed on Day_4. Now its time for implementing the pipelining technique for the core, and some additonal instructions. The above architecture is pipelined as follows :

A 3 cycle RISC V pipelined core, with all the base integer instruction sets was developed.
For Load and store a Data memory element was added with neccessary instruction decoding logic.
Register Bypass and Squashing techniques were also incorporated to prevent Read followed by write and branchinghazards, arised due to pipelining.
Testing of the pipeline design was done in same manner with Load and store incorporated in asm code.
Additionally Incorporation of Jump feature (JAL and JALR instructions) was also done.
