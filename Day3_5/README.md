•	TL-Verilog and Makerchip

Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) is a hardware descriptive languagethat extends Verilog in the context of pipelines, it maintains behavior of the circuit while being timing abstract, which means it takes care of retiming.
Makerchip is a free online platform made by Redwood EDA. It supports TL-Verilog, SystemVerilog, and Verilog languages to code, compile, simulate, and debug digital designs.
