The material and code created during the RISC-V MYTH Workshop are housed in this repository. The basic RISC-V ISA was researched and a rudimentary RISC-V core with base instruction set was developed in five days.   In addition to the Makerchip IDE Platform, the RISC-V CPU Core was designed using Transaction Level Verilog (TL-Verilog).
