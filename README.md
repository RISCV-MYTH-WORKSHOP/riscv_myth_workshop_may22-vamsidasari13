The material and code created during the RISC-V MYTH Workshop are housed in this repository. The basic RISC-V ISA was researched and a rudimentary RISC-V core with base instruction set was developed in five days.   In addition to the Makerchip IDE Platform, the RISC-V CPU Core was designed using Transaction Level Verilog (TL-Verilog). 

### Day 1 : Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

•	Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords

•	Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain

•	Integer number representation

•	Signed and unsigned arithmetic operations

### Day 2: Introduction to ABI and basic verification flow

•	Application Binary interface (ABI)

•	Lab work using ABI function calls

•	Basic verification flow using iverilog

### Day 3: Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip

•	Combinational logic in TL-Verilog using Makerchip

•	Sequential and pipelined logic

•	Validity

•	Hierarchy

### Day 4: Basic RISC-V CPU micro-architecture

•	Microarchitecture and testbench for a simple RISC-V CPU

•	Fetch, decode, and execute logic

•	RISC-V control logic

### Day 5: Complete Pipelined RISC-V CPU micro-architecture/store

•	Pipelining the CPU

•	Load and store instructions and memory

•	Completing the RISC-V CPU

•	Wrap-up and future opportunities
