# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

The material and code created during the RISC-V MYTH Workshop are housed in this repository. The basic RISC-V ISA was researched and a rudimentary RISC-V core with base instruction set was developed in five days.   In addition to the Makerchip IDE Platform, the RISC-V CPU Core was designed using Transaction Level Verilog (TL-Verilog). 

For students of "Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours" Workshop, offered by for VLSI System Design (VSD) and Redwood EDA, find here accompanying live info and links.
